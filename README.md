The webpage is divided into 2 part. The 1st half contains the title and settings which allow games against AI. The 2nd half is the game itself and the information of the two players. 

The Tic Tac Toe game was made on a 9 by 9 grid and players can choose their favourite characters out of the 12 choices to represent themselves. There are score counters on top of each player's section to record their wins. It is 5 sec per turn and if a move is not made within the timeframe, a random move would be made for the player 


Better A.I. on both attack and defence; but it takes defense as priority over attack.
Better A.I. means if there is two in a row for the human player, A.I. will make a move to stop it becoming three.
