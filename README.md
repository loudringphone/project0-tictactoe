The webpage is divided into 3 part. The top part is the title. The middle part is the game itself and the information of the two players. The bottom part is to have a reset button.

The Tic Tac Toe game was made on a 9 by 9 grid and players can choose their favourite characters out of the 12 choices to represent themselves. There are score counters on top of each player's section to record their wins. It is 5 sec per turn and if a move is not made with the timeframe, a random move would be made for the player
