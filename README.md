The webpage is divided into 2 part. The 1st half contains the title and settings which allow games against AI. The 2nd half is the game itself and the information of the two players. 

The Tic Tac Toe game was made on a 9 by 9 grid and players can choose their favourite characters out of the 12 choices to represent themselves. There are score counters on top of each player's section to record their wins. It is 5 sec per turn and if a move is not made with the timeframe, a random move would be made for the player 


Better AI on both attack and defence; however it doesn't know how to create opportunity.
